    <h2>How to Make a perfect bowl of Cereal</h2>

    <p>
        This is the one and only way to make a bowl of cereal, as made known unto me by God himself. If a man does not make cereal this way, I say unto you he is a sinner in the eyes of God. The Lord is merciful, yes, but as He said to Paul, "Verily I say unto thee, if ye make a bowl of cereal in any other way, ye shall be cast out, and thrust down to Hell,"(Matthew 69:420).

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Milk (Whole is recommended)</li>
        <li>Your favorite cereal (if it isn't apple jacks you are <b><i>WRONG</i></b>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Add milk to bowl to desired amount. "If ye pour the milk, and it falls upon the cereal, behold, ye have not found favor with God,"(Luke 69:69)" </li>
        <li>Pour in the cereal</li>
    </ol>
